# Travelers_Calculator
Code repository for midterm project

[Google Play link to download app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tc.me&pli=1)

## Last major update: 6/15/21
## UPDATE: 
The ratesapi.io is currently offline; specifically, it has redirected to exchangerates.api - which requires me to have an API key, and even then, my allowed requests are limited off of a free plan. 
Therefore currenlty the currency converter is non functional until I can... figure something out. I will try to update as soon as possible. Sorry :(

## Description:

Traverler's Calculator is an Android app that performs as a basic calculator and unit, currency and time converter.

## Technical Specs:

**Minimum SDK:** API 19 (Android 4.4 - KitKat)

**Orientation:** Portrait

**Permissions:** Internet

### Credits
For retrieving currency converter, I used  https://ratesapi.io currency exchange API. This API updates from the European Central Bank every 24 hours. It is free and open source.

For some calculator functionality, I used Javaluator: http://javaluator.sourceforge.net/en/home/

For sending HTTP requests I used Okhttp: https://square.github.io/okhttp/

For initial onboarding: https://github.com/ramotion/paper-onboarding, and for in-app onboarding: https://github.com/sjwall/MaterialTapTargetPrompt

For a helper in quickly restarting the app for a very specific situation: https://github.com/JakeWharton/ProcessPhoenix

And for the splash screen - which made that easier for me at the time, I used https://github.com/pantrif/EasySplashScreen
 

This was my first Android application. It's not perfect. I know. But I worked pretty hard and continue to work on it.
