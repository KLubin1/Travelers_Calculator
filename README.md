# Travelers_Calculator
Code repository for midterm project

## Last major update: 6/15/21
## UPDATE: 
The ratesapi.io is currently offline; specifically, it has redirected to exchangerates.api - which requires me to have an API key, and even then, my allowed requests are limited off of a free plan. 
Therefore currenlty the currency converter is non functional until I can... figure something out. I will try to update as soon as possible. Sorry:(

Traverler's Calculator is an Android app that performs as a basic calculator and unit, currency and time converter.

## Technical Specs:

**Minimum SDK:** API 19 (Android 4.4 - KitKat)

For retrieving currency converter, I used  https://ratesapi.io currency exchange API. This API updates from the European Central Bank every 24 hours. It is free and open source.
